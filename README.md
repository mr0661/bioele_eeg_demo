# Bioelectronics course work EEG Parkinsons DEMO

## Datasets
Don't upload any large datasets here (I will remove them). Instead, just tell location how to acquire dataset. All data of the data sets should be inserted to directories called "data".

## The dataset provided by the University of New Mexico

### Downloading the dataset
This dataset can be directly downloaded from the following link http://bit.ly/2rfCkNP 

Please add the dataset to exactly this relative path : data\PD_REST\

Total size of the dataset 3.89 GB

It is possible to download selected files. So it is not necessary to download the complete dataset.

### Summary of the dataset

50 subjects -> 25 PD (16 M, 9 F) , 25 Control (16 M, 9 F)

.xlsx files include the details of PD_IDs (An ID unique to the trials) such as Medication Status, Matched Control ID, Age

Loading_Data.m file include the instructions for loading the data and idenfying the electrode names and locations
